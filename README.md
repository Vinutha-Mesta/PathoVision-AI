# 🧬 PathoVision-AI  
### Multiclass Deep Learning Framework for Colon & Lung Cancer Detection from Histopathology Images

PathoVision-AI is a deep learning–based system designed to classify **colon** and **lung** histopathology images into four categories:

- **colon_adenocarcinoma (colon_ada)**
- **colon_normal (colon_n)**
- **lung_adenocarcinoma (lung_ada)**
- **lung_normal (lung_n)**

The model uses advanced convolutional neural networks to extract cellular-level features from microscopic images and performs multiclass classification with high accuracy.
